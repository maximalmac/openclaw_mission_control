# Mission Control Backlog

## Planned

- [ ] Discord channel -> agent -> model routing
  - Goal: allow different Discord channels to run different AI models.
  - Approach: create per-channel agents with dedicated primary models, then bind channels to those agents.
  - Notes: prefer this over ad-hoc per-session overrides for long-term stability.

## Process

- [x] For each Mission Control change batch, review and update (when relevant):
  - Home dashboard "Mission Control Overview" and "To reach full automation"
  - Readiness Checklist statuses/milestones
